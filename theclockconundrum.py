"""There are many ways to implement the solution, but many involve a lot of casework. Below is the shortest solution we know of.
Walk around the clock in the order 1, 2, â€¦, 12. If we pass by two red strings or two blue strings in a row, the strings don't intersect; otherwise, they do.
This is because if we don't have two red or blue in a row, then the red and blue strings alternate, so there must be an intersection."""
